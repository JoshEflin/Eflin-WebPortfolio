To do:

Nav bar down side

Each section takes up 100% of screen width and height so that when I scroll to a section I dont see other sections as well

all work projects display on a single screen width/height card, the first project is double the size of the others

 reinvert the color scheme back to white background

 on cell phones the portfolio section displays 2 cards per row
 except the first project which is takes up a whole flex row

 when page is shrunk, use CSS animation to resize cards
